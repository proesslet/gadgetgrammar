# Gadget Grammar

## Tech Stack

- Vue 3
- Boostrap 5 (for styling) - https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/getting-started/introduction/
- NodeJS
- MongoDB

## To Run the Project:

1. Open split terminals in VS Code. In one terminal, cd into `api` and in the other, cd into `Gadget-Grammar`
2. Run `npm install` in each terminal
3. In `Gadget-Grammar` run `npm run dev`

## Project Structure

### Api

- This is all the backend code. Nothing exists yet so it won't run anything

### Gadget-Grammar

- This is all the frontend code. It currently only has boiler plate code from the Vue initialization, but it runs at least
